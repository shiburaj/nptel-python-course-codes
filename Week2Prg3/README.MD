## **Signal Stability Checker**

Signal processors analyze sequences of numerical measurements to determine whether a signal is **consistently increasing over time**.

- - -

### **Problem Description**

You are given a sequence of integers representing signal measurements taken over time.

A signal is said to be **strictly increasing** if **every element is greater than the previous one**.

- - -

### **Input Format**

*   A single line containing **space-separated integers** representing signal measurements.
    

- - -

### **Output Format**

*   Print **`True`** if the sequence is **strictly increasing**.
    
*   Otherwise, print **`False`**.
    

     The program must **always print exactly one Boolean value**.

- - -

### **Constraints**

*   Input contains at least **one integer**.
    
*   All values are integers.
