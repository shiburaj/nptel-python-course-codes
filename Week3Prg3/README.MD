### **Problem Statement**

Word Length Comparator

**Problem Statement:**

Text analysts compare words based on their lengths. Write a program to perform the following steps:

1.  Accept a comma-separated list of words.
    
2.  Calculate the average length of the words.
    
3.  **Round up** the average to the nearest whole number (Ceiling value).
    
4.  Count how many words have a length **strictly greater** than this rounded average.
    

**Input Format:**

A single line containing comma-separated words.

**Output Format:**

Print a single integer count.

**Example Calculation (for clarity):**

*   **Input:** `one,two,three,four`
    
*   **Word Lengths:** 3, 3, 5, 4
    
*   **Mathematical Average:** (3+3+5+4) / 4 = 3.75
    
*   **Rounded Average (Ceiling):** 4 (Always round up decimal values)
    
*   **Comparison:** Check which words have length \> 4.
    
    *   `one` (3) > 4? No.
        
    *   `two` (3) > 4? No.
        
    *   `three` (5) > 4? **Yes.**
        
    *   `four` (4) > 4? No.
        
*   **Count:** 1
